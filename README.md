## Abstract

This paper develops a developmental–epistemic account of the newborn’s first cry as the primordial epistemic event and the foundation of psychological development. Far from a reflex, the cry is framed as the embodied registration of contradiction, helplessness, and finitude. The caregiver’s response constitutes the earliest fiduciary scaffold: recognition dignifies contradiction and scaffolds resilience, while neglect, inconsistency, or silencing rehearse epistemic clientelism. Extending the _Kahl Model of Epistemic Dissonance_ (KMED) into infancy, I implement Python-based simulations (KMED-I) that formalise how caregiver policies generate divergent developmental trajectories of epistemic autonomy, dissonance tolerance, and dependence. The results map directly onto attachment theory, reframing secure, avoidant, ambivalent, and disorganised styles as epistemic lessons in survivability of contradiction. More broadly, the paper reconceives cognitive dissonance not as bias or pathology but as structural grammar of epistemic life, reinterprets attachment as epistemic trust, and demonstrates how biases function as scripts in the social grammar of clientelism. Clinical implications follow: trauma and gaslighting as breaches of fiduciary scaffolds, and therapy as fiduciary repair. Philosophically, the findings support the claim that autonomy and dependence are co-constituted from the first cry, grounding an ethic of epistemic care that extends from infancy to institutions.
