## Abstract

This paper develops a developmental–epistemic account of the newborn’s first cry as the primordial epistemic event and the foundation of psychological development. Far from being a reflex, crying is conceptualised as the embodied registration of contradiction—helplessness, need, and finitude voiced into the world. The caregiver’s response establishes the first fiduciary scaffold: recognition and comfort dignify contradiction and script resilience, whereas neglect, inconsistency, or silencing rehearse epistemic clientelism. To formalise this dynamic, the _Kahl Model of Epistemic Dissonance_ (KMED) is extended into the infant–caregiver dyad (KMED-I) and implemented in Python-based simulations. The models show how distinct caregiving policies produce divergent trajectories of epistemic autonomy (EA), dissonance tolerance (DT), and dependence (D). These outcomes map onto classical attachment styles, reinterpreted here as epistemic lessons: secure attachment scripts resilience, avoidant scripts silence, ambivalent scripts hyperactivation, and disorganised scripts incoherence. In this way, the paper reframes dissonance not as a cognitive bias but as the grammar of epistemic life, inscribing durable scripts that extend from the cradle to intimate, institutional, and political contexts. The argument has implications for developmental psychology, psychiatry, attachment theory, and fiduciary ethics, advancing the foundations of epistemic psychology.
