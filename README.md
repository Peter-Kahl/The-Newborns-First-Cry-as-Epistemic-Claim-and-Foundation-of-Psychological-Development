## Abstract

This paper develops a developmental–epistemic account of the newborn’s first cry as the earliest epistemic claim and the foundation of psychological development. Far from a reflex, crying is framed as an epistemic event: the embodied registration of contradiction, helplessness, and finitude at the threshold of life. The caregiver’s response constitutes the first fiduciary scaffold. Recognition and comfort transform dissonance into resilience, while neglect, silencing, or inconsistency rehearse the logic of epistemic clientelism. To formalise these dynamics, the _Kahl Model of Epistemic Dissonance_ (KMED) is extended into an infant–caregiver setting and implemented in Python-based simulations. The models show how distinct caregiving policies—fiduciary, inconsistent, neglectful, or silencing—generate divergent developmental trajectories of epistemic autonomy, dissonance tolerance, and dependence.

Beyond simulation, the paper advances three conceptual moves: first, a reinterpretation of attachment styles as epistemic trust profiles; second, a reframing of so-called cognitive “biases” as developmental scripts acquired through early cry–response exchanges; and third, a normative account of care as fiduciary practice. Taken together, these contributions reposition infancy as the crucible of epistemic life and dissonance as its structural grammar. The argument has implications across developmental psychology, attachment theory, psychiatry, and clinical practice, establishing psychology itself as a fiduciary science of epistemic scaffolding.
