## Abstract

This paper develops a developmental–epistemic account of the newborn’s first cry as the earliest epistemic claim and the foundation of psychological development. Rather than a reflex, crying is framed as an epistemic event: the embodied registration of contradiction, helplessness, and finitude at the threshold of life. The caregiver’s response constitutes the first fiduciary scaffold. Recognition and comfort transform dissonance into resilience, while neglect, silencing, or inconsistency rehearse the logic of epistemic clientelism. To formalise these dynamics, the _Kahl Model of Epistemic Dissonance_ (KMED) is extended into an infant–caregiver setting and implemented in Python-based simulations. The models show how distinct caregiving policies—fiduciary, inconsistent, neglectful, or silencing—generate divergent developmental trajectories of epistemic autonomy, dissonance tolerance, and dependence. These findings establish infancy as the crucible of epistemic life, reframing attachment as epistemic trust and psychological development as contingent upon the dignification of contradiction. The argument has implications for developmental psychology, attachment theory, psychiatry, and clinical practice.
