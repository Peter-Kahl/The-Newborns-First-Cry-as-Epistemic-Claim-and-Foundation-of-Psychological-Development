# KMED-I (Infancy) — Cry–Response Dyad Simulator

![A stylised illustration of a mother holding her smiling infant, rendered in warm orange tones. The image symbolises the newborn’s cry and caregiver recognition as the foundational exchange of epistemic life, where comfort and care scaffold resilience and autonomy.](https://github.com/Peter-Kahl/KMED-I-infant-cry-response-dyad-simulator/blob/main/mum_baby.jpg?raw=true)

This repository contains the official Python implementation of KMED-I (Infancy) — a simulation framework modelling the infant–caregiver cry–response dyad.

KMED-I formalises the newborn’s cry as the first epistemic event, extending the _Kahl Model of Epistemic Dissonance_ (KMED) into developmental psychology. It models how caregiver policies—fiduciary, inconsistent, neglectful, or silencing—shape trajectories of:

- **Epistemic Autonomy (EA)** – persistence in signalling contradiction
- **Dissonance Tolerance (DT)** – capacity to withstand contradiction
- **Dependence (D)** – reliance on suppression versus recognition

The framework provides a computational tool for exploring epistemic clientelism, resilience, and trust, bridging intimate caregiving contexts with broader institutional and social applications.
